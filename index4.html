    <h1>Summary </h1>
    <p>There is a discussion about Trevor Noah's journey in the first two chapters. The disparities and racial inequalities that existed in South Africa.<br>
        He discusses the Immorality Act of 1927, a rule passed in South Africa that made it illegal for white people and black people to have sex.These<br>
        prepared the ground for discussing racial tensions, discrimination, and apartheid's effects on people's lives and families. Noah's mother Patricia<br>
        fled her house to live and work in Johannesburg. Because she could not trust anyone and because it was against the law for Black people to reside <br>
        in the city,she was forced to hide. Being "a mixed child," Noah had to hide most of the time to avoid being seen, which had an impact on his<br> 
        relationship with his father. He discusses the customs, history, and culture of his native nation. The story of Noah's voyage tells of South Africa's<br>
        fight for equality and racial injustice. Every Sunday, Trevor's mother, a devoted Christian, escorted her family to many different churches.  African Americans<br>
        in South Africa were classified into tribes before the implementation of apartheid. There was a lengthy history of hostilities between these tribes and the<br> 
        Xhosa and Zulu. Because Xhosa women were viewed as prostitutes, a bus driver once chastised Noah's mother for taking their kids on a late-night trip without<br>
        a male companion.Tribalism is a major problem in Busia County since one tribe is given preference. While some tribes are left behind, others enjoy easier<br> 
        access to resources and jobs.These play a major role in the existence of the rich and poor classes. Most of the time, single mothers are looked down upon<br> 
        and criticized in society for not having a man. Women are religious in society. You'll discover that ladies attend meetings, women's day, and fellowships in<br>
        addition to Sunday church services.  They ensure their kids attend church and serve as the driver of Christianity in their homes. They relocate to different<br> 
        churches most of the time. They think that every church has something unique to offer. Since many people do not have a source of income and rebel against<br> 
        stealing, insecurity is a daily issue that needs to be handled. Drivers for Uber and Matatu may assault their passengers and commit crimes. The matatu<br>
        drivers argue over patrons and call one other names offensively.</p>
