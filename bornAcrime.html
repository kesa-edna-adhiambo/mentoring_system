    <h2>Summary Of Born A Crime </h2>
    
    <p> Trevor Noah explains the disparities and racial inequalities that existed in South Africa. He discusses the Immorality Act of 1927, discussing racial tensions,<br><br>
        a rule passed in South Africa that made it illegal for white people and black people to have sex. These prepared the ground for discrimination, and apartheid's<br><br>
        effects on people's lives and families.<br><br><br> Noah's mother Patricia fled her house to live and work in Johannesburg. Because she could not trust anyone and because it  was against the law for Black<br><br>
        people to reside in the city,she was forced to hide. Being "a mixed child ", Noah had to hide most of the time to avoid being seen, which had an impact on <br><br>
        his relationship. <br><br><br> The story of Noah's voyage tells of South Africa's fight for equality and racial injustice. Every Sunday, Trevor's mother,  a devoted Christian, escorted her<br><br>
        family to many different churches. African Americans in South Africa were classified into tribes before the implementation of apartheid. There was a lengthy<br><br> 
        history of hostilities between these tribes and the Xhosa and Zulu. Because Xhosa women were viewed as prostitutes, a bus driver once chastised Noah's mother<br><br>
        for taking their kids on a late-night trip without a male companion.<br><br><br>

    <h2>How It Relates To My County</h2>

        Tribalism is a major problem in Busia County since one tribe is given preference. While some tribes are left behind, others enjoy easier access to resources and<br><br>
        jobs. These play a major role in the existence of the rich and poor classes. Most of the time, single mothers are looked down upon and criticized in society for<br><br>
        not having a man.<br><br><br>
        Women are religious in society. You'll discover that ladies attend meetings, women's day, and fellowships in addition to Sunday church services. They ensure their<br><br>
        kids attend church and serve as the driver of Christianity in their homes. They relocate to different churches most of the time. They think that every church has<br><br>
        something unique to offer. Since many people do not have a source of income and rebel against stealing, insecurity is a daily issue that needs to be handled. Drivers<br><br>
        for Uber and Matatu may assault their passengers and commit crimes. The matatu drivers argue over patrons and call one other names offensively.</p>
